# Information

My colemak layout (without `teensy button`) http://configure.ergodox-ez.com/keyboard_layouts/qajjmk/edit 

I aim for symmetry of modifier keys, primarily: I get Emacs Pinky quite quickly when using a standard (1 ctrl button) laptop keyboard.


## Updating the keyboard layout

Use ErgoDox EZ configurator (with my layout as the basis): http://configure.ergodox-ez.com/keyboard_layouts/qajjmk/edit

This great configurator has loads of extra keys that I had to add manually, and painfully, to a `C` file.

## Updating keyboard layout

* Run teensy.app from teensy.dmg
* Press +L1 then teensy button (on the old layout, EZ layout configurator doesn't have this `teensy button`)
* Open newest .hex file
* Program
* Reboot
